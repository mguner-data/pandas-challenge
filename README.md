In this study, I have analyzed a gaming company customer and purchase dataset.  I discuss the insights I obtained based on the data
anaysis below.
The dataset I looked at consist of 576 total number of players.  Some players did multiple purchases of the different game products.

1) Majority of the gamers are male with 84%, female gamers are 14%. This will make the male players the top spenders in total spending.
However, if we take a look at purchase per person, on average a female gamer spends($4.47) 9.8% more than a male gamer($4.07). 
Company might target increasing the female gamers, since they spend more on average.

2) Peak age demographic of the gamers falls between 20-24 (44.8%) with secondary groups falling between 15-19 (18.58%) and 25-29 (13.37%).
However, per person gamers less than 10 years old and the gamers of age range 35-39 spend the most money on average.  Company might target 
more gamers between the age range of 35-39. 

3) Most popular and most profitable item of the gaming company is "Final Critic" and it was followed by "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the
Breaking Storm".  Company might spend more time and effort on maintaining and improving these games to cater the gamers.
